# **Smart Home Security Simulation**
### *An OOP-based Project by Aaryan Panda*

---

> *"Modern problems require modern solutions."*  
> *This project simulates a basic smart home security system, focusing on the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++.*

---

## **Overview**
A virtual environment that **simulates a smart home security system** to demonstrate core **OOP concepts**. The project is designed to be simple yet **maintainable** and can be extended with additional features.

## **Components**
- **Motion Detectors:** Detects motion within rooms.
- **Door Sensors:** Monitors the status of doors.
- **Alarm System:** Triggers alerts based on sensor inputs.
- **Control Panel:** Provides a simple interface for system status.

## **Key OOP Concepts**
- **Classes & Objects:** Components are modeled as classes (e.g., `MotionDetector`, `DoorSensor`, `Alarm`, `ControlPanel`), with objects representing system elements.
- **Encapsulation:** Hides internal workings, exposing only necessary methods.
- **Abstraction:** Focuses on essential functionalities.
- **Polymorphism:** Methods behave differently based on the object calling them.
- **Inheritance:** New classes are derived from existing ones.

## **Programming Language**
**C++**  
Chosen for its **strong OOP support** and **performance efficiency**. Offers **resource control** and extensive **library support**.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
The project can be expanded with:
- **Advanced Sensors:** Integrate more sophisticated detection systems.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement continuous status updates.
- **User Authentication:** Add security layers for user access.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project showcases the practical application of OOP in a real-world scenario, highlighting the simplicity and power of **C++** in building maintainable systems. The project is a foundation for further exploration and enhancement.
